# üëã Hello, I'm Necmettin √áimen\!

I am a passionate and experienced Full Stack Developer, driven by my love for programming. I dedicate a significant portion of my daily life to writing code and finding innovative solutions to problems through software development. My journey in software development is not just a profession, but a deep-seated interest that fuels my continuous learning and proactive approach to challenges.

Currently, I serve as the **Head of Software** at Forceget Supply Chain Logistics, a leadership role that highlights my technical depth and significant career progression.

## üöÄ My Expertise & Tech Stack

My technical proficiency spans a wide array of modern technologies, reflecting my versatility and strong grasp of contemporary development and DevOps practices.

I possess a comprehensive skill set, including:

  * **Backend Development:**.Net Core, C\#, Go, Node, Python
  * **Frontend Development:** Angular, React, SCSS, HTML, JavaScript, TypeScript
  * **Mobile Development:** Flutter, React Native
  * **DevOps & Cloud:** Docker, Kubernetes
  * **Other Tools & Concepts:** Software Development, Full Stack Development, OpenGL C++

My technology stack has evolved over time, demonstrating my commitment to continuous learning and adapting to industry trends. While I started with more traditional frameworks like.Net MVC and ASPX, my recent experience includes modern and widely adopted technologies such as.Net Core, Angular, Flutter, Docker, and Kubernetes. This adaptability makes me a versatile professional capable of working with both legacy systems and cutting-edge solutions.

This indicates my ability to manage the entire software lifecycle, from development to deployment, scaling, and automation.

Furthermore, my experience at Enal Yazƒ±lƒ±m, where I developed and successfully published mobile applications using React Native on the Google Play Store, showcases my versatility beyond traditional web development. This demonstrates a complete understanding of the mobile application lifecycle, from initial development to final distribution and publication on a public app store.
